#Ex 5.6.3

#Michael:

#This exercize is confusing.  Not sure what is being accomplished here?  The code in listing 5.37 doesn't seem to be accomplishing anything.  Indeed, completely commenting out the code in 5.37 allows the test to run successfully!


#describe ApplicationHelper do

#  describe "full_title" do
#    it "should include the page title" do
#      full_title("foo").should =~ /foo/
#    end

#    it "should include the base title" do
#      full_title("foo").should =~ /^Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample App/
#    end

#    it "should not include a bar for the home page" do
#      full_title("").should_not =~ /\|/
#    end
#  end
#end
